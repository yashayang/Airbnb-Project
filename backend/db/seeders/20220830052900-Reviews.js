Absolutely world class architecture and a time capsule of mid-century modern style. Without A/C the heat can be a bit much at first, but it doesnt take long to figure out which windows to open and which to close at the right times to make it more comfortable. We will likely stay here again next year.',

There were a couple of minor problems, since we were traveling with a toddler: for instance, the master bedroom is not connected to the rest of the house. Its on the other side a small deck. The deck has walls that enclose it, so its still quite private. But for having a toddler, it wasnt ideal (we ended up staying in the other bedroom with our son in the small TV room).',
